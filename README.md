## Summary

 - This React Native app provides seamless login functionality using Google Sign-In integration, ensuring secure authentication without requiring users to input their email and password directly into the app. 
 - Upon successful login, users are navigated to the Home screen, which features a carousel image slider and various visually appealing charts suitable for business use.
 - The header at the top of the Home screen displays the user's name, and clicking on it navigates the user to the Profile screen, where their information, including user image and email, is displayed.
 - Additionally, the Profile screen includes a logout button, allowing users to securely log out of the app. 

 - The app is designed to check if the user is already logged in when the app is opened. If the user is logged in, the Home screen is displayed directly; otherwise, the Login screen is shown.
